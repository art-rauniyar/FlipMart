## Use Case 1: Personalized Product Recommendations üìç

### 1.1 Recommending items based on Past Purchase History üõí
Users often purchase similar items repeatedly, especially in the grocery segment. To provide valuable recommendations based on previous orders, we established connections between a user‚Äôs current purchases and their past ones.  
We utilized the **Apriori Algorithm** from Association Rule Learning (ARL) to detect these associations between products.

### 1.2 Recommending items based on Ratings from Similar Users ‚≠ê
Users from the same region may share common dietary habits and food preferences. To discover similar patterns among users, we applied **Memory-based Collaborative Filtering** using the **nearest neighbors algorithm**. This approach helps us analyze user rating data and recommend products that align with the preferences of users with similar tastes.

- **Viewing Recipe Details:** Allows users to see all the required ingredients and cooking instructions.
